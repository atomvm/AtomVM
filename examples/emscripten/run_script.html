    <h1>Run script example</h1>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates calling <code>emscripten:run_script/1</code> and
      <code>emscripten:run_script/2</code> to run Javascript from Erlang.
    </p>

    <p>It displays three alerts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An alert in the main thread, synchronously</li>
      <li>An alert in the main thread, asynchronously</li>
      <li>An alert in the worker thread</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Second alert is likely to appear after third alert.</p>

    <p>
      On non-SMP builds, it demonstrates the fact that Erlang continues to run
      when <code>emscripten:run_script/2</code> is called with
      <code>[main_thread]</code> as a counter is incremented while waiting for
      first alert to complete. The value is <span id="demo-counter">unset</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the counter, this example also demonstrates manipulating DOM (in
      the main thread) using JS function.
    </p>
