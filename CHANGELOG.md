## [0.6.7] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added `lists:keysort/2`
- Added `lists:merge/2,3`

### Fixed

bigger than 60-bit on 64-bit CPUs).

### Changed

- lists sort function now use a stable merge sort implementation instead of quick sort

## [0.6.6] - 2025-06-23

### Added

- Added the ability to run beams from the CLI for Generic Unix platform (it was already possible
with nodejs and emscripten)

might lead to a crash in certain situations.

- Fixed `network:stop/0` on ESP32 so the network can be started again
- Fixed a memory corruption caused by `binary:split/2,3`
- Fixed deadlock in socket code
- Fixed bug in opcode implementation (`select_val`): when selecting a value among many others a
shallow comparison was performed, so it was working just for plain values such as atoms and small
integers
- Fixed support for setting esp32 boot_path in NVS.
- Fixed race conditions in network:start/stop.
- Fixed crash calling network:sta_rssi(), when network not up.
- Fixed error handling when calling `min` and `max` with code compiled before OTP-26: there was a

- Fixed matching of binaries on unaligned boundaries for code compiled with older versions of OTP
- Added missing out of memory handling in binary_to_atom

- Fixed potential memory corruption when handling integer immediates that are stored as boxed
integer (this never happens with integers < 28 bits)
- Correctly set Pico-W unique dhcp hostname when using the default, previously all rp2040 devices
used the same "PicoW" dhcp hostname, causing collisions when multiple rp2040 are on the same
network. (See issue #1094)

### Changed

- ESP32 UART driver no longer aborts because of badargs in configuration, instead raising an error
- ESP32: `v0.6.6` uses esp-idf v5.4.1 for pre-built images and `v5.4.x` is the suggested release
also for custom builds

- Install AtomVM libraries source code and binaries for better dialyzer integration

details for the channel changes can be observed in the console log if "debug" level logging is enabled
in ESP-IDF Kconfig options.
- Default size of ESP32 RTC slow memory from 4086 to 4096, except on ESP32-H2 where it's 3072

### Changed
- Stacktraces are included by default on Pico devices.
- Changed ssl default from `{active, false}` to `{active, true}` in order to have same behavior as
OTP. Since active mode is not supported right now, `active` must be explicitly set to false:

cause other issues. The bug has been introduced with messages from tasks change between beta.1
and rc.0
- Fixed several issues related to Esp32 socket_driver that made it unreliable, especially with
single core MCUs

## [0.6.0-rc.0] - 2024-03-03

### Added

- `BOOTLOADER_OFFSET` for all current Esp32 models.

- Sending messages to registered processes using the `!` operator now works.
- Fixed bug in `OP_SEND` that would accept sending a message to any integer or term without raising an error.
- `binary_to_term` checks atom encoding validity, and fix latin1 support (when non-ASCII chars are
used)
- ESP32: fixed bug in `gpio:set_pin_mode/2` and `gpio:set_direction/3` that would accept any atom for the mode parameter without an error.

  and arbitrary-length reads and writes from SPI devices.

- Added functions `esp:sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup/2` and `esp:sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup/2.`
- Added support for FP opcodes 94-102 thus removing the need for `AVM_DISABLE_FP=On` with OTP-22+
- Added support for stacktraces
- Added support for `utf-8`, `utf-16`, and `utf-32` bit syntax modifiers (put and match)
- Added support for Erlang `gpio:close/1` and Elixir `GPIO.close/1` for ESP32
- Added support for the Erlang `gen_event` module
- Added `start_link` support for the `network` module
- Added support for `erlang:monotonic_time/1`
- Added `start_link` support for the `gen_statem` module
- Added support for serializing floats in erlang external term encoding
- Added support for the `SMALL_BIG_EXT` erlang external term encoding
- Added support for `erlang:memory(binary)`
- Added support for callbacks on SNTP updates
- Multithreading support (SMP)
- Added support for code:load_abs/1, code:load_binary/3
- Added support for loading / closing AVMPacks at runtime
- Added support for ESP-IDF v5.x
- Added support for `calendar:system_time_to_universal_time/2`
- Added support for `calendar:datetime_to_gregorian_seconds/1`
- Added support for Raspberry Pi Pico
- Added support for nodejs with Wasm
- Added support for a subset of the OTP logger interface
- Added `esp:partition_list/0` function
- Added `esp:nvs_fetch_binary/2` and `nvs_put_binary/3` functions (`esp:nvs_set_binary` and
functions that default to `?ATOMVM_NVS_NS` are deprecated now).
- Added most format possibilities to `io:format/2` and `io_lib:format/2`
- Added `unicode` module with `characters_to_list/1,2` and `characters_to_binary/1,2,3` functions
- Added support for `crypto:hash/2` (ESP32 and generic_unix with openssl)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with formatting integers with io:format() on STM32 platform
- Fixed a bug in the order of child initialization in the `supervisor` module
- Fixed a bug in the evaluation of `receive ... after infinity -> ...` expressions
- Fixed a bug in when putting integers in bit syntax with integer field sizes
- Fixed numerous bugs in memory allocations that could crash the VM
- Fixed SNTP support that had been broken in IDF 4.x builds
- Fixed `erlang:send/2` not sending to registered name

### Breaking Changes

> IMPORTANT: These changes are incompatible with previous releases of AtomVM.

- Changed the configuration model of the SPI driver, in order to allow for multiple "follower"
  devices to be attached to the same SPI Bus.
- Changed the return value from `erlang:system_info(esp32_chip_info)` from a tuple to a map, with
additional information.
- Changed the return type of the `network:start` function to return the tuple `{ok, Pid}` on a
successful call, instead of the bare atom `ok`.  Applications that use `network:start` and
check the return value will need to be modified.
- The return type of `i2c:read_bytes` has changed from returning just a binary to
returning the tuple `{ok, Binary}` when successful.
- The return type of many `i2c` operations under error conditions has changed from
`error` to `{error, Reason}`, for improved diagnostics.
- The eavmlib logger interface has been removed

### Removed
- ESP-IDF v3.x support.

## [0.5.1] - Unreleased
### Added
- New function for atom comparison, useful when writing 3rd party components.
- New function for translating an atom term to an int value, according to a given translation table.
  This function can be used for translating an atom term to an enum const before doing a switch.
- New no-op `ATOM_STR(...)` macro for avoiding issues with clang-format.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_PORT_DRIVER` for registering additional port drivers without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new components by just copying them to the components directory.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_NIF_COLLECTION` for registering additional NIFs sets without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new NIFs by just copying them to the components directory.
- New function for getting a map or proplist value using an atom string without poluting the atom
  table.

### Fixed
- Fix `gen_statem`: Cancel outstanding timers during state transitions in
  order to prevent spurious timeout messages from being sent to `gen_statem`
  process.
- Fix missing Elixir libraries: examvlib was not packed into atomvmlib.avm
- Fix `bs_context_to_binary`: match offset wasn't used, leading in certain situations to infinite loops
  while matching binaries.
- Fix how `start` option was handled from `bs_restore2` instruction: last saved match offset was
  used instead of match starting offset, causing some bytes being skipped.
- Fix another potential bug when doing pattern matching using code compiled with OTP 21.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Allow using different pins for rx, tx, cts and rts.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Replace custom UART handling with esp-idf UART event queues, hence other UARTs
  than UART0 are supported, with better performances and stability.
- Fix binaries concat (`bs_append` instruction) that was adding some extra zeroes at the end of
  built binaries.
- Fixed a bug in `gen_tcp` that prevents an accepting socket from inheriting settings on the listening socket.
- Fixed a bug in packing and unpacking integers into and from binaries when the
  bit length is not a multiple of 8.
- Fixed `esp:deep_sleep/1` that did not accept values above 31 minutes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause processes to hang indefinitely when calling ports that have terminated.
- Fixed potential VM crash when parsing external terms.
- Fixed the enforcement of `min_free_space` process option.
