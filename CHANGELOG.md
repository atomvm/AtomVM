All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0-rc.1] - 2024-03-03

### Changed

- ESP32: force SMP for all devices, regardless the number of cores, in order to fix issue with
sockets on ESP32-C3 and similar.

## [0.6.0-rc.0] - 2024-03-03

### Added

- `BOOTLOADER_OFFSET` for all current Esp32 models.
- Added API to send messages from FreeRTOS tasks or pthreads, typically to
easily support integration with Esp32 callbacks

### Fixed

- `BOOTLOADER_OFFSET` was incorrect for Esp32-C6 and Esp32-S2.
- Fixed a bug that would fail to set DHCP hostname in STA+AP mode on all ESP32 platforms.
- ESP32-S3: crash in network driver caused by a smaller stack size for scheduler threads, when
calling `esp_wifi_init()`. See also issue [#1059](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues/1059).
- Fixed Esp32 network driver on non-SMP builds
- ESP32: fixed bug in `gpio:stop/0` and `gpio:close/1` that would cause the VM to crash.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] - 2024-02-28

### Added

- Support for utf8 encoding to `*_to_atom` and `atom_to_*` functions
- `binary_to_atom/1` and `atom_to_binary/1` that default to utf8 (they were introduced with OTP23)
- Added Pico cmake option `AVM_WAIT_BOOTSEL_ON_EXIT` (default `ON`) to allow tools to use automated `BOOTSEL` mode after main application exits
- Use UTF-8 encoding for atoms when using `erlang:term_to_binary/1`, in conformance with OTP-26
- Pico: Wait for USB serial connection `cmake` configuration option `AVM_USB_WAIT_SECONDS` added with 20 second default.
- Support for code that makes use of more than 16 live registers, such as functions with > 16
parameters and complex pattern matchings.

### Fixed

- ESP32: fix i2c_driver_acquire and i2c_driver_release functions, that were working only once.
- Sending messages to registered processes using the `!` operator now works.
- Fixed bug in `OP_SEND` that would accept sending a message to any integer or term without raising an error.
- `binary_to_term` checks atom encoding validity, and fix latin1 support (when non-ASCII chars are
used)
- ESP32: fixed bug in `gpio:set_pin_mode/2` and `gpio:set_direction/3` that would accept any atom for the mode parameter without an error.
- ESP32: GPIO driver fix bug that would accept invalid `pull` direction, and silently set `pull` direction to `floating` without issuing an error.
- ESP32: fixed bug in gpio driver that would accept invalid pin numbers (either negative, or too large)
- RP2040: fixed bug in `gpio:set_pin_pull/2` that would accept any parameter as a valid `pull` mode.
- Support to function with 10 or more parameters
- Very unlikely but possible corruption caused by generated code that uses 16 live registers

### Changed

- `binary_to_atom/2` validates utf8 strings
- `*_to_atom` and `atom_to_*` properly convert latin1 (not just ASCII) to utf8 and viceversa
- ESP32: use esp-idf v5.1.3 for building release binaries

- Fixed SNTP support that had been broken in IDF 4.x builds
- Fixed `erlang:send/2` not sending to registered name

### Breaking Changes

> IMPORTANT: These changes are incompatible with previous releases of AtomVM.

- Changed the configuration model of the SPI driver, in order to allow for multiple "follower"
  devices to be attached to the same SPI Bus.
- Changed the return value from `erlang:system_info(esp32_chip_info)` from a tuple to a map, with
additional information.
- Changed the return type of the `network:start` function to return the tuple `{ok, Pid}` on a
successful call, instead of the bare atom `ok`.  Applications that use `network:start` and
check the return value will need to be modified.
- The return type of `i2c:read_bytes` has changed from returning just a binary to
returning the tuple `{ok, Binary}` when successful.
- The return type of many `i2c` operations under error conditions has changed from
`error` to `{error, Reason}`, for improved diagnostics.
- The eavmlib logger interface has been removed

### Removed
- ESP-IDF v3.x support.

## [0.5.1] - Unreleased
### Added
- New function for atom comparison, useful when writing 3rd party components.
- New function for translating an atom term to an int value, according to a given translation table.
  This function can be used for translating an atom term to an enum const before doing a switch.
- New no-op `ATOM_STR(...)` macro for avoiding issues with clang-format.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_PORT_DRIVER` for registering additional port drivers without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new components by just copying them to the components directory.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_NIF_COLLECTION` for registering additional NIFs sets without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new NIFs by just copying them to the components directory.
- New function for getting a map or proplist value using an atom string without poluting the atom
  table.

### Fixed
- Fix `gen_statem`: Cancel outstanding timers during state transitions in
  order to prevent spurious timeout messages from being sent to `gen_statem`
  process.
- Fix missing Elixir libraries: examvlib was not packed into atomvmlib.avm
- Fix `bs_context_to_binary`: match offset wasn't used, leading in certain situations to infinite loops
  while matching binaries.
- Fix how `start` option was handled from `bs_restore2` instruction: last saved match offset was
  used instead of match starting offset, causing some bytes being skipped.
- Fix another potential bug when doing pattern matching using code compiled with OTP 21.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Allow using different pins for rx, tx, cts and rts.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Replace custom UART handling with esp-idf UART event queues, hence other UARTs
  than UART0 are supported, with better performances and stability.
- Fix binaries concat (`bs_append` instruction) that was adding some extra zeroes at the end of
  built binaries.
- Fixed a bug in `gen_tcp` that prevents an accepting socket from inheriting settings on the listening socket.
- Fixed a bug in packing and unpacking integers into and from binaries when the
  bit length is not a multiple of 8.
- Fixed `esp:deep_sleep/1` that did not accept values above 31 minutes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause processes to hang indefinitely when calling ports that have terminated.
- Fixed potential VM crash when parsing external terms.
- Fixed the enforcement of `min_free_space` process option.
