- Only support ESP32P4 on ESP-IDF v5.5.2, v5.4.4 and later.
- ESP32: SPI peripheral defaults to `"spi2"` instead of deprecated `hspi`
- Added `zlib:compress/1`
- Entry point now is `init:boot/1` if it exists. It starts the kernel application and calls `start/0` from the
  identified startup module. Users who started kernel application (typically for distribution) must no longer
  do it. Startint `net_kernel` is still required.

- `bsl` now properly checks for overflow
- `binary_to_integer/1` no longer accepts binaries such as `<<"0xFF">>` or `<<"  123">>`
- `binary_to_integer` and `list_to_integer` do not raise anymore `overflow` error, they raise
instead `badarg`.
- Resources are now references instead of empty binaries.
- Badarg error return from calling crypto:crypto_one_time with invalid arguments now matches OTP24+.

### Fixed

- ESP32: improved sntp sync speed from a cold boot.
- Fixed `gen_server` internal messages to match OTP so it works across erlang distribution
- Utilize reserved `phy_init` partition on ESP32 to store wifi calibration for faster connections.
- Support for zero count in `lists:duplicate/2`.

- Fixed a bug where empty atom could not be created on some platforms, thus breaking receiving a message for a registered process from an OTP node.
- Fix a memory leak in distribution when a BEAM node would monitor a process by name.
- Fix `list_to_integer`, it was likely buggy with integers close to INT64_MAX
- Added missing support for supervisor `one_for_all` strategy.

### Changed

- lists sort function now use a stable merge sort implementation instead of quick sort

- Fixed race conditions in network:start/stop.
- Fixed crash calling network:sta_rssi(), when network not up.
- Fixed error handling when calling `min` and `max` with code compiled before OTP-26: there was a

- Fixed matching of binaries on unaligned boundaries for code compiled with older versions of OTP
- Added missing out of memory handling in binary_to_atom

used the same "PicoW" dhcp hostname, causing collisions when multiple rp2040 are on the same
network. (See issue #1094)
- Fixed possible memory corruption when doing binary matching.
- Fixed an issue related to binary matching and more precisely endianness of bit skipping with OTP 25 and lower

details for the channel changes can be observed in the console log if "debug" level logging is enabled
in ESP-IDF Kconfig options.
- Default size of ESP32 RTC slow memory from 4086 to 4096, except on ESP32-H2 where it's 3072

### Changed
- Stacktraces are included by default on Pico devices.
- Changed ssl default from `{active, false}` to `{active, true}` in order to have same behavior as
OTP. Since active mode is not supported right now, `active` must be explicitly set to false:

single core MCUs

## [0.6.0-rc.0] - 2024-03-03

### Added

- `BOOTLOADER_OFFSET` for all current Esp32 models.

- Sending messages to registered processes using the `!` operator now works.
- Fixed bug in `OP_SEND` that would accept sending a message to any integer or term without raising an error.
- `binary_to_term` checks atom encoding validity, and fix latin1 support (when non-ASCII chars are
used)
- ESP32: fixed bug in `gpio:set_pin_mode/2` and `gpio:set_direction/3` that would accept any atom for the mode parameter without an error.
- ESP32: GPIO driver fix bug that would accept invalid `pull` direction, and silently set `pull` direction to `floating` without issuing an error.

- Fixed `erlang:send/2` not sending to registered name

### Breaking Changes

> IMPORTANT: These changes are incompatible with previous releases of AtomVM.

- Changed the configuration model of the SPI driver, in order to allow for multiple "follower"
  devices to be attached to the same SPI Bus.
- Changed the return value from `erlang:system_info(esp32_chip_info)` from a tuple to a map, with
additional information.
- Changed the return type of the `network:start` function to return the tuple `{ok, Pid}` on a
successful call, instead of the bare atom `ok`.  Applications that use `network:start` and
check the return value will need to be modified.
- The return type of `i2c:read_bytes` has changed from returning just a binary to
returning the tuple `{ok, Binary}` when successful.
- The return type of many `i2c` operations under error conditions has changed from
`error` to `{error, Reason}`, for improved diagnostics.
- The eavmlib logger interface has been removed

### Removed
- ESP-IDF v3.x support.

## [0.5.1] - Unreleased
### Added
- New function for atom comparison, useful when writing 3rd party components.
- New function for translating an atom term to an int value, according to a given translation table.
  This function can be used for translating an atom term to an enum const before doing a switch.
- New no-op `ATOM_STR(...)` macro for avoiding issues with clang-format.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_PORT_DRIVER` for registering additional port drivers without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new components by just copying them to the components directory.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_NIF_COLLECTION` for registering additional NIFs sets without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new NIFs by just copying them to the components directory.
- New function for getting a map or proplist value using an atom string without poluting the atom
  table.

### Fixed
- Fix `gen_statem`: Cancel outstanding timers during state transitions in
  order to prevent spurious timeout messages from being sent to `gen_statem`
  process.
- Fix missing Elixir libraries: examvlib was not packed into atomvmlib.avm
- Fix `bs_context_to_binary`: match offset wasn't used, leading in certain situations to infinite loops
  while matching binaries.
- Fix how `start` option was handled from `bs_restore2` instruction: last saved match offset was
  used instead of match starting offset, causing some bytes being skipped.
- Fix another potential bug when doing pattern matching using code compiled with OTP 21.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Allow using different pins for rx, tx, cts and rts.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Replace custom UART handling with esp-idf UART event queues, hence other UARTs
  than UART0 are supported, with better performances and stability.
- Fix binaries concat (`bs_append` instruction) that was adding some extra zeroes at the end of
  built binaries.
- Fixed a bug in `gen_tcp` that prevents an accepting socket from inheriting settings on the listening socket.
- Fixed a bug in packing and unpacking integers into and from binaries when the
  bit length is not a multiple of 8.
- Fixed `esp:deep_sleep/1` that did not accept values above 31 minutes.
- Fixed a bug that could cause processes to hang indefinitely when calling ports that have terminated.
- Fixed potential VM crash when parsing external terms.
- Fixed the enforcement of `min_free_space` process option.
