## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - Unreleased
### Added
- New function for atom comparison, useful when writing 3rd party components.
- New function for translating an atom term to an int value, according to a given translation table.
  This function can be used for translating an atom term to an enum const before doing a switch.
- New no-op `ATOM_STR(...)` macro for avoiding issues with clang-format.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_PORT_DRIVER` for registering additional port drivers without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new components by just copying them to the components directory.
- [ESP32] `REGISTER_NIF_COLLECTION` for registering additional NIFs sets without editing any
  source file. This allows adding new NIFs by just copying them to the components directory.

### Fixed
- Fix `gen_statem`: Cancel outstanding timers during state transitions in
  order to prevent spurious timeout messages from being sent to `gen_statem`
  process.
- Fix missing Elixir libraries: examvlib was not packed into atomvmlib.avm
- Fix `bs_context_to_binary`: match offset wasn't used, leading in certain situations to infinite loops
  while matching binaries.
- Fix how `start` option was handled from `bs_restore2` instruction: last saved match offset was
  used instead of match starting offset, causing some bytes being skipped.
- Fix another potential bug when doing pattern matching using code compiled with OTP 21.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Allow using different pins for rx, tx, cts and rts.
- [ESP32] [UART]: Replace custom UART handling with esp-idf UART event queues, hence other UARTs
  than UART0 are supported, with better performances and stability.
- Fix binaries concat (`bs_append` instruction) that was adding some extra zeroes at the end of
  built binaries.
- Fixed a bug in gen_tcp that prevents an accepting socket from inheriting settings on the listening socket.
- Fixed a bug in packing and unpacking integers into and from binaries when the
  bit length is not a multiple of 8.
- Fixed a bug that could cause processes to hang indefinitely when calling ports that have terminated.
