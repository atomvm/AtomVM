# AtomVM Examples

AtomVM includes a collection of useful examples for getting started.  This section describes what these examples do, and how to run them, for example, on an ESP32 device.

## Erlang Examples

Erlang examples may be run in the UNIX shell or on supported microcontroller devices.

### `hello_world`

This example program prints the string "Hello World" and quits.

#### Command line

The `hello_world.avm` file will get created as part of a build.  This file may be supplied as an argument to the `AtomVM` command:

    shell$ ./src/AtomVM ./examples/erlang/hello_world.avm
    Hello World
    Return value: ok

### `udp_server`

This example program listens on UDP port 44444 and will print information about the received message, including the source IP, (ephemeral) source port, and packet received, to the console.

#### Command line

The `udp_server.avm` file will get created as part of a build.  This file may be supplied as an argument to the `AtomVM` command:

    shell$ ./src/AtomVM ./examples/erlang/udp_server.avm
    Opening socket ...
    {socket,<0.3.0>,44444}
    Waiting to receive data...

You can send UDP packets to the AtomVM instance using `netcat` (or `nc` on some platforms), in a separate terminal window:

    shell$ nc -u localhost 44444

This command will wait for you to enter a line of text, e.g.,

    testing 1 2 3

In the AtomVM termianl window, you see:

    Address: {127,0,0,1}
    Port: 50889
    Packet: <<116,101,115,116,105,110,103,32,49,32,50,32,51,10>>
    Waiting to receive data...

> Note.  Netcat appends a newline character at the end of the input, so the packet binary does not display as printable text.

### `udp_client`

This example program send the packet of data (":アトムＶＭ") over UDP to port 44444 on the loopback address every 5 seconds, in a loop.  The program will print a period (`.`) to the console, every time it sends a message.

This command may be used in tandem with the `udp_server` program to illustrate sending messages between AtomVM processes over UDP.

#### Command line

The `udp_client.avm` file will get created as part of a build.  This file may be supplied as an argument to the `AtomVM` command:

    shell$ ./src/AtomVM ./examples/erlang/udp_client.avm
    Opening socket...
    .................................

If you are running the `udp_server` program, you should see messages like the following printed to the console:

    Address: {127,0,0,1}
    Port: 52443
    Packet: <<58,-94,-56,-32,54,45>>
    Waiting to receive data...

> Note. AtomVM does not currently treat characters outside of the printable ASCII character set as printable characters.

## ESP32 Examples

AtomVM includes examples that are specifically designed for the ESP32 and other microcontrollers.

## Flashing AtomVM Examples for ESP32

In order to run the ESP32 examples, you will need to flash the example AVM files that are created as part of the build to your device.

In the remainder of this document, we assume a script `flash.sh`, which has something like the following contents:

    #!/bin/sh
    ${IDF_PATH}/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py \
        --chip esp32 \
        --port /dev/ttyUSB0 \
        --baud 115200 \
        --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
        write_flash -u --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x110000 ${1}

> Note.  Set the IDF_PATH environement variable to be the root directory of the ESP IDF tool, which you have installed as part of the AtomVM build tool chain.

> Note.  Substitute the USB serial device on your platform for `/dev/ttyUSB0`, in this script.

You can montor the console output of these examples by issuing the `monitor` target to `make`, in the `src/platforms/esp32` directory of the AtomVM source tree:

    shell$ make monitor
    MONITOR
    --- WARNING: Serial ports accessed as /dev/tty.* will hang gdb if launched.
    --- Using /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART instead...
    --- idf_monitor on /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART 115200 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---

    ...

### `blink`

The `blink` example will turn the blue LED on an ESP32 SoC (pin 2) on and off, once every second.

Flash the example program to your device as follows:

    shell$ flash.sh examples/erlang/esp32/blink.avm
    esptool.py v2.6-beta1
    Serial port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART

    Leaving...
    Hard resetting via RTS pin...

You should see the blue LED turn on and off on your ESP32 device.

### `sta_network`

The `sta_network` example will connect to your local WiFi network and obtain and IP address.  Once a connection is established, a `connected` message will be displayed.  Once an IP address is obtained, the device IP address, netmask, and gateway will be displayed on the console.

> Note.  AtomVM currently only supports station mode (STA).

> Note.  AtomVM currently only supports IPv4 addresses.

> Note.  You will need to edit the `examples/erlang/esp32/sta_network.erl` source file and set the `ssid` and `psk` parameters to match your local WiFi network, and then rebuild the example.

Flash the example program to your device as follows:

    shell$ flash.sh examples/erlang/esp32/sta_network.avm
    esptool.py v2.6-beta1
    Serial port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART

### `udp_server_blink`

The `udp_server_blink` example will connect to your local WiFi network and obtain and IP address.  It will then start a UDP server on port 44444.  When a UDP message is received, the blue LED on the ESP32 SoC (pin 2) will toggle on and off.

> Note.  AtomVM currently only supports station mode (STA).

> Note.  AtomVM currently only supports IPv4 addresses.

> Note.  You will need to edit the `examples/erlang/esp32/udp_server_blink.erl` source file and set the `ssid` and `psk` parameters to match your local WiFi network, and then rebuild the example.

Flash the example program to your device as follows:

    shell$ flash.sh examples/erlang/esp32/udp_server_blink.avm
    esptool.py v2.6-beta1

You can send UDP packets to the AtomVM instance using `netcat` (or `nc` on some platforms), in a separate terminal window:

Every time you enter a line of text, the blue LED on the ESP32 SoC (pin 2) should toggle on and off.
