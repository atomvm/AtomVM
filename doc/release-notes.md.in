# Release Notes

Welcome to AtomVM `@ATOMVM_VERSION@`

These release notes provide version information about the current release of AtomVM.

## Required Software

The following software is required to develop Erlang or Elixir applications on AtomVM:

* An [Erlang/OTP](https://erlang.org) compiler (`erlc`)
* The [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) runtime, if developing Elixir applications.
* (recommended) For Erlang programs, [`rebar3`](https://rebar3.org)
* (recommended) For Elixir programs, [`mix`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html), which ships with the Elixir runtime.

AtomVM will run BEAM files that have been compiled using the following Erlang and Elixir versions:

| Erlang Version | Elixir Version |
|----------------|----------------|
| ✅ OTP 21 | ✅ 1.7 |
| ✅ OTP 22 | ✅ 1.8 |
| ✅ OTP 23 | ✅ 1.11 |
| ✅ OTP 24 | ✅ 1.14 |
| ✅ OTP 25 | ✅ 1.14 |
| ✅ OTP 26 | ✅ 1.15 |

> Note. Versions of Elixir that are compatible with a particular OTP version may work.  This table reflects the versions that are tested.

Not all BEAM instructions are supported for every Erlang and Elixir compiler.  For details about which instructions are supported, see the `src/libAtomVM/opcodes.h` header file in the  [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/) github repository corresponding to the current release.

For detailed information about features and bug fixes in the current release, see the AtomVM [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md).

### ESP32 Support

To run applications built for AtomVM on the ESP32 platform you will need:

* The [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program, for flashing the AtomVM image and AtomVM programs to ESP32 MCUs.
* A serial console program, such as `minicom` or `screen`, so that you can view console output from your AtomVM application.

AtomVM currently supports the following versions of ESP-IDF:

| Espressif supported versions | AtomVM support |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| ESP-IDF v4.4 | ✅ |
| ESP-IDF v5.0 | ✅ |
| ESP-IDF v5.1 | ✅ |

Building the AtomVM virtual machine for ESP32 is optional.  In most cases, you can simply download a release image from the AtomVM [release](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases) repository.  If you wish to work on development of the VM or use one on the additional drivers that are available in the ([AtomVM repositories](https://github.com/atomvm)) you will need a compatible version of ([Espressif's](https:/espressif.com)) ESP-IDF.  Espressif provides excellent [installation documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.4/esp32/get-started/index.html).

### STM32 Support

The following software is required to build AtomVM for the STM32 platform:

| Package |

| [11.3 ARM toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz) |
| [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git) version 0.8.0 |

> Note.  AtomVM tests this build on the latest Ubuntu github runner.

### Raspberry Pi Pico Support

The following software is required to build AtomVM for the Raspberry Pi Pico platform:

| Package |
|---------|
| `gcc-arm-none-eabi` |
| `libnewlib-arm-none-eabi` |
