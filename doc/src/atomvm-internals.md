# AtomVM Internals

## What is an Abstract Machine?

AtomVM is an "abstract" or "virtual" machine, in the sense that it simulates, in software, what a physical machine would do when executing machine instructions.  In a normal computing machine (e.g., a desktop computer), machine code instructions are generated by a tool called a compiler, allowing an application developer to write software in a high-level language (such as C).  (In rare cases, application developers will write instructions in assembly code, which is closer to the actual machine instructions, but which still requires a translation step, called "assembly", to translate the assembly code into actual machine code.)  Machine code instructions are executed in hardware using the machine's Central Processing Unit (CPU), which is specifically designed to efficiently execute machine instructions targeted for the specific machine architecture (e.g., Intel x86, ARM, Apple M-series, etc.)  As a result, machine code instructions are typically tightly packed, encoded instructions that require minimum effort (on the part of the machine) to unpack an interpret.  These a low level instructions unsuited for human interpretation, or at least for most humans.

AtomVM and virtual machines generally (including, for example, the Java Virtual Machine) perform a similar task, except that i) the instructions are not machine code instructions, but rather what are typically called "bytecode" or sometimes "opcode" instructions; and ii) the generated instructions are themselves executed by a runtime execution engine written in software, a so-called "virtual" or sometimes "abstract" machine.  These bytecode instructions are generated by a compiler tailored specifically for the virtual machine.  For example, the `javac` compiler is used to translate Java source code into Java VM bytecode, and the `erlc` compiler is used to translate Erlang source code into BEAM opcodes.

AtomVM is an abstract machine designed to implement the BEAM instruction set, the 170+ (and growing) set of virtual machine instructions implemented in the Erlang/OTP BEAM.

```{note}
There is no abstract specification of the BEAM abstract machine and instruction set.  Instead, the BEAM
implementation by the Erlang/OTP team is the definitive specification of its behavior.
```

At a high level, the AtomVM abstract machine is responsible for:

* Loading and execution of the BEAM opcodes encoded in one or more BEAM files;
* Managing calls to internal and external functions, handling return values, exceptions, and crashes;
* Creation and destruction of Erlang "processes" within the AtomVM memory space, and communication between processes via message passing;
* Memory management (allocation and reclamation) of memory associated with Erlang "processes"
* Pre-emptive scheduling and interruption of Erlang "processes"
* Execution of user-defined native code (Nifs and Ports)
* Interfacing with the host operating system (or facsimile)

This document provides a description of the AtomVM abstract machine, including its architecture and the major components and data structures that form the system.  It is intended for developers who want to get involved in bug fixing or implementing features for the VM, as well as for anyone interested in virtual machine internals targeted for BEAM-based languages, such as Erlang or Elixir.

## AtomVM Data Structures

This section describes AtomVM internal data structures that are used to manage the load and runtime state of the virtual machine.  Since AtomVM is written in C, this discussion will largely be in the context of [native C data structures](./apidocs/libatomvm/data_structures.rst) (i.e., `structs`).  The descriptions will start at a fairly high level but drill down to some detail about the data structures, themselves.  This narrative is important, because memory is limited on the target architectures for AtomVM (i.e., micro-controllers), and it is important to always be aware of how memory is organized and used in a way that is as space-efficient as possible.

### The GlobalContext

We start with the top level data structure, the `GlobalContext` struct.  This object is a singleton object (currently, and for the foreseeable future), and represents the root of all data structures in the virtual machine.  It is in essence in 1..1 correspondence with instances of the virtual machine.

:::{doxygenstruct} GlobalContext
   :allow-dot-graphs:

:::
````

```{note}
Given the design of the system, it is theoretically possible to run multiple instances of the AtomVM in one process
space.  However, no current deployments make use of this capability.
```

In order to simplify the exposition of this structure, we break the fields of the structure into manageable subsets:

* Process management -- fields associated with the management of Erlang (lightweight) "processes"
* Atoms management -- fields associated with the storage of atoms
* Module Management -- fields associated with the loading of BEAM modules
* Reference Counted Binaries -- fields associated with the storage of binary data shared between processes
* Other data structures

These subsets are described in more detail below.

```{warning}
Not all fields of the `GlobalContext` structure are described in this document.
```

#### Process Management

As a BEAM implementation, AtomVM must be capable of spawning and managing the lifecycle of Erlang lightweight processes.  Each of these processes is encapsulated in the [`Context` structure](#contexts), described in more detail in subsequent sections.

The `GlobalContext` structure maintains a list of running processes and contains the following fields for managing the running Erlang processes in the VM:

* `processes_table` the list of all processes running in the system
* `waiting_processes` the subset of processes that are waiting to run (e.g., waiting for a message or timeout condition).
* `running_processes` the subset of processes that are currently running.
* `ready_processes` the subset of processes that are ready to run.

Processes are in either `waiting_processes`, `running_processes` or `ready_processes`.  A running process can technically be moved to the ready list while running to signify that if it yields, it will be eligible for being run again, typically if it receives a message.  Also, native handlers (ports) are never moved to the `running_processes` list but are in the `waiting_processes` list when they run (and can be moved to `ready_processes` list if they are made ready while running).

Each of these fields are doubly-linked list (ring) structures, i.e, structs containing a `prev` and `next` pointer field.  The `Context` data structure begins with two such structures, the first of which links the `Context` struct in the `processes_table` field, and the second of which is used for either the `waiting_processes`, the `ready_processes` or the `running_processes` field.

```{tip}
The C programming language treats structures in memory as contiguous sequences of fields of given types.  Structures
have no hidden preamble data, such as you might find in C++ or who knows what in even higher level languages.  The
size of a struct, therefore, is determined simply by the size of the component fields.
```

The relationship between the `GlobalContext` fields that manage BEAM processes and the `Context` data structures that represent the processes, themselves, is illustrated in the following diagram:

The [Context](#contexts) data structure is described in more detail below.

## JIT and native code execution

### Flavors of the emulator

Following BEAM, there are two flavors of the emulator: jit and emu, but eventually four distinct execution modes:

- Emulated (this is the default): the VM emulates BEAM bytecode and embedded libraries do not include any JIT compiler.
- JIT (this is closest to BEAM's): the VM only runs native code and embedded libraries includes the JIT compiler precompiled to native code.
- Native: the VM only runs native code and all code must be precompiled on the desktop using the JIT compiler (which effectively is a AOT or Ahead-of-Time compiler). In this mode, it is not necessary to bundle the jit compiler on the embedded target.
- Hybrid: the VM can run native code as well as emulated BEAM code and some code is precompiled on the desktop.

JIT is available on some platforms (currently only x86_64 and aarch64) and compiles Erlang bytecode at runtime. Erlang bytecode is never interpreted. EMU is available on all platforms and Erlang bytecode is interpreted.

Modules can include precompiled code in a dedicated beam chunk with name 'avmN'. The chunk can contain native code for several architectures, however it may only contain native code for a given version of the native interface. Current version is 1. This native code is executed by the jit-flavor of the emulator as well as the emu flavor if execution of precompiled is enabled.

JIT is an experimental feature and is currently disabled by default. Enabling JIT disables the interpreter.
JIT can enabled with `-DAVM_DISABLE_JIT=Off`

Execution of precompiled modules can be enabled even if JIT is disabled (this is the hybrid mode above), with `-DAVM_DISABLE_JIT=On -DAVM_ENABLE_PRECOMPILED=On`

The jit target is detected at compile time using CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but it can be forced by defining `AVM_JIT_TARGET_ARCH` for example with `-DAVM_JIT_TARGET_ARCH=aarch64`.

### How JIT works internally

The JIT compiler is written in Erlang and is therefore precompiled. When a process calls a function in a module with no precompiled code, the process is trapped and a message is sent to the `code_server`. The code server then compiles the bytecode to native code and then resumes the trapped process.

JIT compiler is composed of two main interfaces : backend and stream.

A backend implementation is required for each architecture. The backend is called by jit module as it translates bytecodes to machine code. The current implementations are `jit_x86_64` and `jit_aarch64` which are suitable for systems with System V X86 64 ABI or AArch64 ABI.

A stream implementation is responsible for streaming the machine code, especially in the context of low memory. Two implementations currently exist: `jit_stream_binary` that streams assembly code to an Erlang binary, suitable for tests and precompilation on the desktop, and `jit_stream_mmap` that streams assembly code in an `mmap(2)` allocated page, suitable for JIT compilation on Unix.

## The Scheduler

In SMP builds, AtomVM runs one scheduler thread per core.  Scheduler threads are actually started on demand.  The number of scheduler threads can be queried with [`erlang:system_info/1`](./apidocs/erlang/estdlib/erlang.md#system_info1) and be modified with [`erlang:system_flag/2`](./apidocs/erlang/estdlib/erlang.md#system_flag2).  All scheduler threads are considered equal and there is no notion of main thread except when shutting down (main thread is shut down last).

Each scheduler thread picks a ready process and execute it until it yields.  Erlang processes yield when they are waiting (for a message) and after a number of reductions elapsed.  Native processes yield when they are done consuming messages (when the handler returns).

Once a scheduler thread is done executing a process, if no other thread is waiting into `sys_poll_events`, it calls `sys_poll_events` with a timeout that correspond to the time to wait for next execution.  If there are ready processes, the timeout is 0.  If there is no ready process, this scheduler thread will wait into `sys_poll_event` and depending on the platform implementation, the CPU usage can drop.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenfunction} sys_poll_events
````

If there already is one thread in `sys_poll_events`, other scheduler threads pick the next ready process and if there is none, wait.  Other scheduler threads can also interrupt the wait in `sys_poll_events` if a process is made ready to run.  They do so using platform function `sys_signal`.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenfunction} sys_signal
````

## Tasks and synchronization mechanisms

AtomVM SMP builds run on operating or runtime systems implementing tasks (FreeRTOS SMP on ESP32, Unix and WebAssembly) as well as on systems with no task implementation (Raspberry Pi RP2).

On runtime systems with tasks, each scheduler thread is implemented as a task. On RP2, a scheduler thread runs on Core 0 and another one runs on Core 1, and they are effectively pinned to each core.

For synchronization purposes, AtomVM uses mutexes, condition variables, RW locks, spinlocks and Atomics.

Availability of RW Locks and atomics are verified at compile time using detection of symbols for RW Locks and `ATOMIC_*_LOCK_FREE` C11 macros for atomics.

Mutexes and condition variables are provided by the SDK or the runtime system. If RW Locks are not available, AtomVM uses mutexes. Atomics are not available on RP2 and are replaced by critical sections. Spinlocks are implemented by AtomVM on top of Atomics, or using mutexes on RP2.

Importantly, locking synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, RW locks, spinlocks) are not interrupt-safe. Interrupt service routines must not try to lock as they could fail forever if interrupted code owns the lock. Atomics, including emulation on RP2040, are interrupt-safe.

Drivers can send messages from event callbacks typically called from FreeRTOS tasks using `globalcontext_send_message_from_task` or `port_send_message_from_task` functions instead of `globalcontext_send_message` or `port_send_message`. These functions try to acquire required locks and if they fail, enqueue sent message in a queue, so it is later processed when the scheduler performs context switching. The functions are undefined if option `AVM_DISABLE_TASK_DRIVER` is passed. Some platforms do not include support for task drivers. Define `AVM_TASK_DRIVER_ENABLED` can be checked to determine if these functions are available.

## Mailboxes and signals

Erlang processes receive messages in a mailbox.  The mailbox is the interface with other processes.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenstruct} Message
>:allow-dot-graphs:
>
>:::
````

When a sender process sends a message to a recipient process, the message is first enqueued into an outer mailbox.  The recipient process eventually moves all messages from the outer mailbox to the inner mailbox.  The reason for the inner and outer mailbox is to use lock-free data structures using atomic CAS operations.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenstruct} Mailbox
>:allow-dot-graphs:
>
>:::
````

Sometimes, Erlang processes need to query information from other processes but without sending a regular message, for example when using [`process_info/1,2`](./apidocs/erlang/estdlib/erlang.md#process_info2) nif.  This is handled by signals.  Signals are special messages that are enqueued in the outer mailbox of a process.  Signals are processed by the recipient process when regular messages from the outer mailbox are moved to the inner mailbox.  Signal processing code is part of the main loop and transparent to recipient processes.  Both native handlers and erlang processes can receive signals.  Signals are also used to run specific operation on other processes that cannot be done from another thread.  For example, signals are used to perform garbage collection on another process.

When an Erlang process calls a nif that requires such an information from another process such as `process_info/1,2`, the nif returns a special value and set the `Trap` flag on the calling process.  The calling process is effectively blocked until the other process is scheduled and the information is sent back using another signal message.  This mechanism can also be used by nifs that want to block until a condition is true.

## Stacktraces

Stacktraces are computed from information gathered at load time from BEAM modules loaded into the application, together with information in the runtime stack that is maintained during the execution of a program.  In addition, if a BEAM file contains a `Line` chunk, additional information is added to stack traces, including the file name (as defined at compile time), as well as the line number of a function call.

```{tip}
Adding line information to a BEAM file adds non-trivial memory overhead to applications and should only be used
when necessary (e.g., during the development process).  For applications to make the best use of memory in tightly
constrained environments, packagers should consider removing line information all together from BEAM files and rely
instead on logging or other mechanisms for diagnosing problems in the field.
```

Newcomers to Erlang may find stacktraces slightly confusing, because some optimizations taken by the Erlang compiler and runtime can result in stack frames "missing" from stack traces.  For example, tail-recursive function calls, as well as function calls that occur as the last expression in a function clause, don't involve the creation of frames in the runtime stack, and consequently will not appear in a stacktrace.

### Line Numbers

Including file and line number information in stacktraces adds considerable overhead to both the BEAM file data, as well as the memory consumed at module load time.  The data structures used to track line numbers and file names are described below and are only created if the associated BEAM file contains a `Line` chunk.

#### The line-refs table

The line-refs table is an array of 16-bit integers, mapping line references (as they occur in BEAM instructions) to the actual line numbers in a file.  (Internally, BEAM instructions do not reference line numbers directly, but instead are indirected through a line index).  This table is stored on the `Module` structure.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenstruct} Module
>:allow-dot-graphs:
>
>:::
````

This table is populated when the BEAM file is loaded.  The table is created from information in the `Line` chunk in the BEAM file, if it exists.  Note that if there is no `Line` chunk in a BEAM file, this table is not created.

The memory cost of this table is `num_line_refs * 2` bytes, for each loaded module, or 0, if there is no `Line` chunk in the associated BEAM file.

#### The filenames table

The filenames table is a table of (usually only 1?) file name.  This table maps filename indices to `ModuleFilename` structures, which is essentially a pointer and a length (of type `size_t`).  This table generally only contains 1 entry, the file name of the Erlang source code module from which the BEAM file was generated.  This table is stored on the `Module` structure.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenstruct} ModuleFilename
>
>:::
````

Note that a `ModuleFilename` structure points to data directly in the `Line` chunk of the BEAM file.  Therefore, for ports of AtomVM that memory-map BEAM file data (e.g., ESP32), the actual file name data does not consume any memory.

The memory cost of this table is `num_filenames * sizeof(struct ModuleFilename)`, where `struct ModuleFilename` is a pointer and length, for each loaded module, or 0, if there is no `Line` chunk in the associated BEAM file.

#### The line-ref-offsets list

The line-ref-offsets list is a sequence of `LineRefOffset` structures, where each structure contains a ListHead (for list book-keeping), a 16-bit line-ref, and an unsigned integer value designating the code offset at which the line reference occurs in the code chunk of the BEAM file.  This list is stored on the `Module` structure.

````{only} html
>:::{doxygenstruct} LineRefOffset
>:allow-dot-graphs:
>
>:::
````

This list is populated at code load time.  When a line reference is encountered during code loading, a `LineRefOffset` structure is allocated and added to the line-ref-offsets list.  This list is used at a later time to find the line number at which a stack frame is called, in a manner described below.

The memory cost of this list is `num_line_refs * sizeof(struct LineRefOffset)`, for each loaded module, or 0, if there is no `Line` chunk in the associated BEAM file.

## ETS Tables

AtomVM includes a very basic implementation of the OTP ETS interface, allowing applications to efficiently store term data in tables, and to access term data across processes.

> For information about ETS tables from the user's perspective, see the AtomVM [Programmers Guide](programmers-guide.md).

ETS tables are represented internally by the `EtsTable` structure, which records information about the table configured by the user (via `ets:new/2`), such as the table name, whether is it a named table, the access type (`private`, `protected`, or `public`), the key position, etc.

ETS tables are uniquely identifiable via Erlang references, and generally this reference is returned as the "table identifier" when an ETS table is created (via `ets:new/2`).  ETS tables can also be referenced via their name, if they are designated as a "named table" in configuration.  Table identifiers are unique, and the ETS implementation also ensures that if tables are named, they are named uniquely.

In addition, the `EtsTable` structure records the table type, which in the current implementation is limited to the `set` type.  Future versions may support alternative table types (`ordered_set`, `bag`, `duplicate_bag`).

For the `set` table type, the `EtsTable` instantiates an `EtsHashTable`, a  hash table implementation with an array of buckets (to which keys hash), and for each bucket, a (possibly empty) linked list of `HNode` elements, where `HNode` in the list contains a reference to an AtomVM `Heap` (fragment).  Each `Heap` instance stores a copy of the tuple element that has been added to the table (via `ets:insert/2`).  The `HNode` also stores a `term` representing the key used to store the element, as well as a term representing the element, itself.  Note that the `key` and `entry` term fields refer to elements stored in the heap fragment referenced from the `HNode`, not terms in a process heap.

When an element is inserted into the table or retrieved from the table (e.g., via `ets:lookup/2`), the `term` data is copied into or from, respectively, the `Heap` instance stored in the table.  The `Heap` instance in each entry is allocated to hold exactly the amount of data needed to store the `term`.  This `Heap` is owned by the `EtsHashTable`, in the sense that an instance is created when an entry is inserted into the table, and destroyed when an entry is deleted from the table.

For more information about the `Heap` data structure, see the [Memory Management](memory-management.md) chapter of the AtomVM documentation.

```

The `Ets` structure contains a `SyncList` of `EtsTable` structures, protected from concurrent access via a read-write lock.  A single instance of an `Ets` structure is stored in the `GlobalContext` structure.

```{note}
A deficiency in this implementation is that lookup of an ETs table in this list is `O(<number of ETS tables>)`, whereas a "promise" of ETS is that insertion, lookup, and deletion of entries in at least the `set` table type is or should be constant (modulo poor hashing functions).  A future implementation of this data structure could use a map or table structure to make lookup of ETS tables more efficient (i.e., constant), but at the expense of i) increased memory consumption and heap fragmentation, and ii) code complexity.  Given the likely relative paucity of ETS tables instances likely to be instantiated by applications, we feel that using a list of ETS tables is an acceptable tradeoff for embedded systems deployments, but we are open to being wrong about our assumptions.
```

### Ownership and Lookup

An ETS table is conceptually "owned" by the Erlang process that creates it (via `ets:new/2`).  This generally means that:

* The owning process has exclusive access for reading and writing entries in the table (unless the table is declared `public`, in which case other processes may change entries in the table, e.g., via `ets:insert/2` or `ets:delete/2`);
* The lifecycle of the ETS table is associated with the lifecycle of the owning process, meaning that the ETS table is destroyed when the owning process terminates.  Note that any references to the ETS table are invalid once the table has been destroyed.

```{important} AtomVM does not currently support transfer of ownership of an ETS table from one process to another.```

When a table is used in an `ets` operation (e.g., `ets:insert/2`, `ets:lookup/2`, `ets:delete/2`, etc), the `ets_tables` sync list is searched for the first entry in the table that matches the requested table id (as a name or reference).

If the Erlang process that requests a table is the same process that owns the table, then the operation is permitted.  Otherwise, the access type on the table must be `public` in order for an operation that modifies the table (e.g., `ets:insert/2` or `ets:delete/2`) to be permitted, or `protected` in order for an operation that simply reads from the table (e.g., `ets:lookup/2`).

### Key Hashing

A "key" in an ETS table is an arbitrary term.  In order to insert, lookup, or delete a key in an `EtsHashTable`, we need a way to efficiently hash a key into a bucket, preferably without any memory allocation.

The implementation of the `EtsHashTable` uses a variant of the [Character Folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Character_folding) hash algorithm, using a collection of sufficiently large prime numbers for each Erlang term type (atom, integer, tuple, list, map, etc), and adapted to Erlang recursively structured terms.

This algorithm resembles the term hashing algorithm in [OTP](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/cbd1378ee1fde835e55614bac9290b281bafe49a/erts/emulator/beam/utils.c#L644); however, for the purposes of the `EtsHashTable` implementation, the algorithm is not designed to be interoperable with the OTP implementation.  Future versions of AtomVM that, for example, implement the Erlang portable hash function ([`erlang:phash2/1,2`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang#phash2-1)) can be adapted to use the OTP algorithm for this implementation.

### Concurrency

ETS tables are designed to be accessed concurrently from multiple Erlang processes.  Depending on how table are configured, they may be accessed concurrently for reads but serially for writes (typical), or in probably non-standard cases, concurrently for both reads and writes.

The `ets_tables` sync list is protected by a read-write lock, so that multiple processes calling operations that read the list (e.g., for common `ets` operations like `ets:insert/1`, `ets:lookup/2`, or `ets:delete/2`) can do so concurrently, whereas operation that mutate this list (e.g., `ets:new/2` or termination of a process) are serialized with a write lock.

When an `EtsTable` is retrieved from this list, before the read lock is released on the sync list, either a read or write lock is acquired on the `EtsTable`, depending on the operation being called.  For example, operations that change the state of the table, such as `ets:insert/2` or `ets:delete/2`, acquire a write lock, whereas operation that merely read table contents, such as `ets:lookup/2` acquire a read lock.  This way, a lock is held on the `EtsTable` before another thread might race to delete the table, which would otherwise render the reference to the `EtsTable` invalid, and likely crash the VM.

## AtomVM WebAssembly port

WebAssembly or Wasm port of AtomVM relies on Emscripten SDK and library. Even when SMP is disabled (with `-DAVM_DISABLE_SMP=On`), it uses pthread library to sleep when Erlang processes are not running (to not waste CPU cycles).

### NodeJS environment build

The NodeJS environment build of this port is relatively straightforward, featuring NODERAWFS which means it can access files directly like node does.

### Web environment build

The Web environment build of this port is slightly more complex.

Regarding files, `main` function can load modules (beam or AVM packages) using FetchAPI, which means they can be served by the same HTTP server. This is a fallback and users can preload files using Emscripten `file_packager` tool.

The port also uses Emscripten's proxy-to-pthread feature which means AtomVM's `main` function is run in a web worker. The rationale is the browser thread (or main thread) with WebAssembly cannot run a loop such as AtomVM's schedulers. Web workers typically cannot manipulate the DOM and do other things that only the browser's main thread can do. For this purpose, Erlang processes can call [`emscripten:run_script/2`](./apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/emscripten.md#run_script2) function which dispatches the Javascript to execute to the main thread, waiting for completion (with `[main_thread]`) or not waiting for completion  (with `[main_thread, async]`). Waiting for completion of a script on the main thread does not block the Erlang scheduler, other Erlang processes can be scheduled. Execution of Javascript on the worker thread, however, does block the scheduler.

Javascript code can also send messages to Erlang processes using `call` and `cast` functions from `main.c`. These functions are actually wrapped in `atomvm.pre.js`. Usage is demonstrated by `call_cast.html` example.

Cast is straightforward: the message is enqueued and picked up by the scheduler. It is freed when it is processed.

Call allows Javascript code to wait for the result and is based on Javascript promises (related to `async`/`await` syntax).

1. A promise is created (in the browser's main thread) in a map to prevent Javascript garbage collection (this is done by Emscripten's promise glue code).
1. An Erlang resource is created to encapsulate the promise so it is properly destroyed when garbage collected
1. A message is enqueued with the resource as well as the registered name of the target process and the content of the message
1. C code returns the handle of the promise (actually the index in the map) to Javascript Module.call wrapper.
1. The `Module.call` wrapper converts the handle into a Promise object and returns it, so Javascript code can await on the promise.
1. A scheduler dequeues the message with the resource, looks up the target process and sends it the resource as a term
1. The target process eventually calls [`emscripten:promise_resolve/1,2`](./apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/emscripten.md#promise_resolve2) or [`emscripten:promise_reject/1,2`](./apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/emscripten.md#promise_reject2) to resolve or reject the promise.
1. The `emscripten:promise_resolve/1,2` and `emscripten:promise_reject/1,2` nifs dispatch a message in the browser's main thread.
1. The dispatched function retrieves the promise from its index, resolves or rejects it, with the value passed to `emscripten:promise_resolve/2` or `emscripten:promise_reject/2` and destroys it.

Values currently can only be integers or strings.

If the scheduler cannot find the target process, the promise is rejected with "noproc" as a value. As the promise is encapsulated into an Erlang resource, if the resource object's reference count reaches 0, the promise is rejected with "noproc" as the value.
