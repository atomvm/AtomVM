# AtomVM Tooling

AtomVM provides an implementation of the Erlang virtual machine, and as such it provides runtime support for applications targeted for the platform.

However, developers will typically make use of downstream tooling that simplifies the development and provisioning of applications onto devices that are running the on the virtual machine.

This chapter presents an overview of these tools and how they can be used to make you more productive as an AtomVM developer.

Two tools are supported, one for Erlang developers, and one for Elixir developers:

* For Erlang developers: [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](#atomvm_rebar3_plugin)
* For Elixir developers: [`ExAtomVM`](#exatomvm)

## `atomvm_rebar3_plugin`

The [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) is a [rebar3](https://rebar3.org) plugin that can be used to create and flash Erlang applications that run over AtomVM.  Using this plugin greatly simplifies the process of building Erlang applications that run over AtomVM, and is strongly encouraged for all users.

### Prerequisites for `atomvm_rebar3_plugin`

To use the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin), you will need the following software on your development machine:

* A suitable version of the [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org) distribution.  See the [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) for information about supported Erlang/OTP versions.
* A recent version of the [rebar3](https://rebar3.org) command-line tool.
* (optional) The [git](https://git-scm.com) command line tool, to follow examples in this chapter.
* For flashing to ESP32, the [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program.
* For flashing to STM32, `st-flash` via [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink)
* (optional) A serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen), to view console output from a device.
* (recommended) For rp2040 and rp2350, [`picotool`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) for software resets on Raspberry Pi Pico. (optionally used if found in PATH to disconnect active `screen` sessions, which normally prevent flashing)

### Erlang Example Program

To see this plugin in action, we will clone the [`atomvm_examples`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples) Github repository, and build and run the most simple

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples
...
$ cd atomvm_examples/erlang/hello_world
```

From this directory we will run various [rebar3](https://rebar3.org) targets in the steps below.

### Creating an AtomVM AVM file with `rebar3`

To create an AtomVM packbeam file (ending in `.avm`), use the `packbeam` target in the `atomvm` namespace:

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm packbeam
...
===> AVM file written to .../hello_world/_build/default/lib/hello_world.avm
```

```{seealso}
See the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) page for more detailed instructions
about how to use the `packbeam` target.
```

### Running applications on `generic_unix`

If you have installed AtomVM on a generic UNIX platform, you and run the example program directly using the `atomvm` command:

```shell
$ atomvm _build/default/lib/hello_world.avm
Hello World
Return value: ok
```

For instructions about how to install AtomVM on the `generic_unix` platform, see the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started-guide.md#getting-started-on-the-generic-unix-platform)

### Flashing your application with `rebar3`

The [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) supports flash targets for various device types.  These targets are described in more detail below.

#### ESP32

To flash AtomVM AVM file to an ESP32 device, use the `esp32_flash` target in the `atomvm` namespace.  Users will typically specify the device port and baud rate as command-line options to this target.

```{important}
In order to use the `esp32_flash` target, you will need to install the
[`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program.
```

For example:

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm esp32_flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600
...
===> esptool.py --chip auto --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset
    --after hard_reset write_flash -u --flash_mode keep --flash_freq keep --flash_size detect
    0x210000 atomvm_examples/erlang/hello_world/_build/default/lib/hello_world.avm
```

```{tip}
A baud rate of 921600 works well for most ESP32 devices, some can work reliably at higher rates of 1500000, or even
2000000, but some devices (especially those with a 26Mhz crystal frequency, rather than the more common 40 Mhz
crystal) may need to use a slower baud rate such as 115200.
```

> Note.  A baud rate of 921600 works well for most ESP32 devices, some can work reliably at higher rates of 1500000, or even 2000000, but some devices (especially those with a 26Mhz crystal frequency, rather than the more common 40 Mhz crystal) may need to use a slower baud rate such as 115200.

See the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) page for more detailed instructions about how to use the `esp32_flash` target.

You can now use a serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) to view console output from a device.

    I (972) AtomVM: AtomVM application terminated.  Going to sleep forever ...

#### STM32

To flash AtomVM AVM file to an STM32 device, use the `stm32_flash` target in the `atomvm` namespace.

```{important}
In order to use the `stm32_flash` target, you will need to install the  `st-flash` tool from the open source (bsd-3
licensed)[stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink) suite of stm32 utilities.
```

Since the AtomVM core libraries are not flashed to an STM32 device, you will need to include is library in your application.  As part of the build process for the STM32, you will have built the AtomVM core libraries into a file named `atomvmlib.avm`

```{danger}
It is critical that the version of the AtomVM core libraries match the version of the AtomVM virtual machine you
built as part of the STM32 build.  Be sure to use the version of this library (written to `build/lib/atomvmlib.avm`
during the build process).  For more information about how to build AtomVM for the STM32 platform, see the AtomVM
[Build Instructions](./build-instructions.md#building-for-stm32).
```

In general, it is also a good idea to use the prune option when creating your application's AVM file.  This way, only the modules that are needed for your application will be included, which will decrease the size of your application's AVM file, leading to faster development times.

Edit the `rebar.config` so that it includes the following `atomvm_rebar3_plugin` stanza, if it does not already.

```erlang
{atomvm_rebar3_plugin, [
    {packbeam, [prune]}
]}.
```

This stanza will guarantee that the generated packbeam file will be pruned when created.

You will need to first build a packbeam file that includes the AtomVM core libraries.  Use the `packbeam` task in the `atomvm` namespace, and specify the path to the `atomvmlib.avm` file you created as part of the build.

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm packbeam -e /path/to/atomvmlib.avm
```

You may now flash your application to your STM32 device:

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm stm32_flash
...
===> st-flash --reset write _build/default/lib/hello_world.avm 0x8080000
```

For devices with only 512KB of flash the application address is different and must be specified:

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm stm32_flash -o 0x8060000
...
===> st-flash --reset write _build/default/lib/hello_world.avm 0x8060000
```

See the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) page for more detailed instructions about how to use the `stm32_flash` target.

You can now use a serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) to view console output from a device.

#### Raspberry Pi RP2

To generate a Raspberry Pi RP2 uf2 file from an AtomVM AVM file and flash it to an RP2 device, use the `pico_flash` target in the `atomvm` namespace.

For example:

```shell
$ rebar3 atomvm pico_flash
...
===> AVM file written to _build/default/lib/hello_world.avm
===> Resetting device at path /dev/ttyACM0
===> Waiting for the device at path /run/media/${USER}/RPI-RP2 to settle and mount...
===> Copying atomvm_examples/erlang/hello_world/_build/default/lib/hello.uf2 to
     /run/media/${USER}/RPI-RP2...
```

See the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) page for more detailed instructions about how to use the `pico_flash` target. By default it will generate a universal UF2 that works on both RP2040 and RP2350 but you can optionally target only one of socs.

You can now use a serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) to view console output from a device.  The default build will wait 20 seconds for a serial connection to be established before starting the application.

If no connection is made before the timeout is reached the application will start, but the uart console will not be available.  At this point you can use [`picotool`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) to reboot the device into `application` mode.

Example:

```shell
$ picotool reboot -f
The device was asked to reboot into application mode.

$
```

This will again give you 20 seconds to establish a serial monitor connection.  For information about changing this timeout, or locking down the device so that software resets no longer work (requiring that the device be power cycled and the `BOOTSEL` button help when powering on to flash) consult the [rp2040 section](./build-instructions.md#building-for-raspberry-pi-rp2) of the [Build Instructions](./build-instructions.md).

## `ExAtomVM`

The [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) tool is a [mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) plugin that can be used to create and flash [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) applications that run over AtomVM.  Using this plugin greatly simplifies the process of building Elixir applications that run over AtomVM, and is strongly encouraged for new users.

### Prerequisites for `ExAtomVM`

To use the [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) tool, you will need the following software on your development machine:

* A suitable version of the [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org) distribution.  See the [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) for information about supported Erlang/OTP versions.
* A suitable version of the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) distribution.  See the [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) for information about supported Elixir versions.
* (optional) The [git](https://git-scm.com) command line tool, to follow examples in this chapter.
* For flashing to ESP32, the [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program.
* (optional) A serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen), to view console output from a device.

### Elixir Example Program

To see this plugin in action, we will clone the [`atomvm_examples`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples) Github repository, and build and run the most simple

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples
...
$ cd atomvm_examples/elixir/HelloWorld
```

From this directory we will run various [`mix`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) targets in the steps below.

### Creating an AtomVM AVM file with `mix`

To create an AtomVM packbeam file (ending in `.avm`), first use the `mix.deps` target to [mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) in order to download any dependencies:

```shell
$ mix deps.get
* Updating exatomvm (https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM/)
remote: Enumerating objects: 17, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (17/17), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 17 (delta 6), reused 16 (delta 6), pack-reused 0
origin/HEAD set to main
```

You can now use the `mix atomvm.packbeam` task to create a packbeam (ending in `.avm`) file:

```shell
$ mix atomvm.packbeam
==> exatomvm
Compiling 5 files (.ex)
Generated exatomvm app
==> HelloWorld
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
Generated HelloWorld app
No avm_deps directory found.
This message can be safely ignored when standard libraries are already flashed to lib
partition.
```

The `HelloWorld.avm` is located in the top level directory:

```shell
$ ls -l HelloWorld.avm
-rw-rw-r--  1 user  wheel  19120 Oct 13 14:06 HelloWorld.avm
```

```{seealso}
See the [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) page for more detailed instructions about how to use the
`mix atomvm.packbeam` task.
```

### Running on the `generic_unix` platform

If you have installed AtomVM on a generic UNIX platform, you and run the example program directly using the `atomvm` command:

```shell
$ atomvm HelloWorld.avm
Hello World
Return value: ok
```

For instructions about how to install AtomVM on the `generic_unix` platform, see the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started-guide.md)

### Flashing your application with `mix`

The [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) plugin supports flash targets for various device types.  These targets are described in more detail below.

#### ESP32 flash task

To flash AtomVM packbeam file to an ESP32 device, use the `mix atomvm.esp32.flash` task.  Users will typically specify the device port and baud rate as command-line options to this target.

```{important}
In order to use the `mix atomvm.esp32.flash` task, you will need to install the [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program.
```

For example:

```shell
$ mix atomvm.esp32.flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600
```

```{tip}
A baud rate of 921600 works well for most ESP32 devices, some can work reliably at higher rates of 1500000, or even 2000000, but some devices (especially those with a 26Mhz crystal frequency, rather than the more common 40 Mhz crystal) may need to use a slower baud rate such as 115200.
```

See the [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) page for more detailed instructions about how to use the `mix atomvm.esp32.flash` task.

You can now use a serial console program such as [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) or [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) to view console output from a device.

#### STM32 flash task

To flash AtomVM packbeam file to an STM32 device, use the `mix atomvm.stm32.flash` task.

```{important}
In order to use the `mix atomvm.stm32.flash` task, you will need to install the  `st-flash` tool from the open source
(bsd-3 licensed) [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink) suite of stm32 utilities.
```

For example:

```shell
$ mix atomvm.stm32.flash
```

Most devices do not need to enter the default application offset `0x8080000`, but devices with only 512KiB of flash storage need to use `--flash_offset=0x8060000` parameter setting to upload the application to the correct flash location.

BlackPill V2 example:

```shell
$ mix atomvm.stm32.flash --flash_offset=0x8060000
```

If the `st-flash` tool is not in environment PATH, the full path to the `st-flash` tool should be exported to the environment variable `ATOMVM_MIX_PLUGIN_STFLASH`, for example:

```shell
$ export ATOMVM_MIX_PLUGIN_STFLASH=/opt/stlink/bin/st-flash
```

## `atomvm_packbeam`

The [atomvm_packbeam](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_packbeam) tool is a simple command-line utility that allows you to create, inspect, and manipulate AtomVM [PackBEAM](./packbeam-format.md) files.  By convention, PackBEAM files end in the `.avm` suffix and are referred to as "AVM" files, in the remainder of this section.

```{tip}
Users generally do not have a need to use the `packbeam` tool directly.  Instead, the functionality of this tool is
embedded in the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin).
```

### Installation

Consult the [atomvm_packbeam](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_packbeam) Github page for instructions about how to install the `atomvm_packbeam` utility.  Once installed, you should have the `packbeam` command line tool available in your `PATH`.

### Usage

The `packbeam` command supports the following sub-commands:

* `create`  Create an AVM file from a collection of files.
* `list`  List the contents of an AVM file.
* `extract`  Extract elements from an AVM file.
* `delete`  Delete elements from an AVM file.

These sub-commands are described in more detail below.

```{seealso}
These notes provide only a high-level view of this `packbeam` utility.  For more detailed information, see the
[atomvm_packbeam](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_packbeam) Github repository.
```

#### Creating AVM files

To create an AVM from a list of existing files (typically `.beam` files), use the `create` subcommand.  Specify the output `.avm` first, followed by a list of files you would like to include in the output file.  E.g.,

```shell
$ packbeam create output.avm foo.beam bar.beam
```

```{tip}
Creation of AVM files is more typically done via the
[atomvm_rebar3_plugin](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin); however, the `packbeam` command can be used
to inspect and/or manipulate AVM files after they have been created by this plugin.  This isn't typically required,
but in some instances it can be useful.
```

Note that you can supply a previously created AVM file as an input to another creation, which will result in including all the files in the source AVM file in the destination.

```shell
$ packbeam create new_output.avm tapas.beam output.avm
```

You can also embed non-BEAM files in an AVM file.  These files are accessible programmatically withing atomvm via the [`atomvm:read_priv/2`](./apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/atomvm.md#read_priv2) function, described in the AtomVM [Programmer's Guide](./programmers-guide.md).

For example, if you wanted to add a file `my_app/priv/my_file.txt` to a new file, you could use the following command:

```shell
$ packbeam create my_app.beam my_app/priv/my_file.txt my_lib.avm
```

```{important}
There are conventions for embedding non-BEAM files in AVM files that need to be followed in order to be able to
load these files programmatically within AtomVM.  Generally, these files must obey the path
`<module-name>/priv/<path-to-file>`, where `<module-name>` is the name of a module, and `<path-to-file>` is a path
to the embedded file.  (This path may include embedded `/` separators).  Example: `my_app/priv/bubbles/sample.txt`
```

##### Start Flags

An AtomVM application must contain a start entrypoint, i.e., a module that exports the `start/0` function.  You can specify the name of this module via the `--start` flag.  E.g.,

```shell
$ packbeam create --start main my_app.avm foo.beam bar.beam main.beam
```

Use of this flag will ensure that the `main.beam` module will be found first in the search order when the AtomVM virtual machine starts your application.

##### Pruning

Pruning an AVM file is a useful mechanism for making your AVM files smaller, and thus faster to flash and including less data than necessary.  You can prune an AVM using the

```shell
$ packbeam create --start main --prune my_app.beam foo.beam bar.beam main.beam a.beam \
b.beam c.beam
```

Any BEAM files that contain no transitive references from the start module are removed from the output AVM file, making them smaller and less bloated.

```{important}
You can only use the `--prune` option if you specify a `--start` module.
```

#### Listing AVM file contents

You can list the contents of an AVM file via the `list` sub-command.

```shell
$ packbeam list myapp.avm
myapp.beam * [384]
myapp/priv/application.bin [220]
```

Any BEAM files with an exported `start/0` function are listed with an asterisk (`*`).  In general, if you want your application to start from a designated entrypoint, that BEAM file should occur first in the list.

The size (in bytes) of the entries are listed in square brackets (`[]`).

#### Extracting AVM file contents

You can extract elements of an AVM file, writing them to the file system, using the `extract` sub-command.

Specify the directory location into which you would like to extract the files using the `-out` flag, followed by the path to the input AVM file, and a list of paths from the input AVM you would like to extract.

```shell
$ mkdir mydir
$ packbeam extract -out mydir myapp.avm myapp/priv/application.bin
Writing to mydir ...
x myapp/priv/application.bin
```

#### Deleting AVM file contents

You can delete elements of an AVM file using the `delete` sub-command.

Specify the AVM file you would like to write as output (which can be the same as the input AVM file) using the `-out` flag, followed by the path to the input AVM file, and a list of paths from the input AVM you would like to delete.

```shell
$ packbeam delete -out myapp2.avm myapp.avm myapp/priv/application.bin

shell$ packbeam list myapp2.avm
myapp.beam * [384]
```

    extract <options> <avm-file> [<element>]*
        where:
        <avm-file> is an AVM file,
        [<element>]+ is a list of one or more elements to extract
            (if empty, then extract all elements)
        and <options> are among the following:
