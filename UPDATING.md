# AtomVM Update Instructions

## v0.6.6 -> Unreleased
- Ports now represent the native processes. Port drivers should return a port (instead of a pid),
by using `term_port_from_local_process_id` instead of `term_from_local_process_id`. Sockets, from
port socket driver, are also represented by a port and some matching code may need to be updated from
`is_pid/1` to `is_port/1`.
- Ports and pids can be registered. Function `globalcontext_get_registered_process` result now is
a term that can be a `port()` or a `pid()`.

## v0.6.4 -> v0.6.5

- ESP32: `esp32boot.avm` doesn't contain anymore Elixir standard library, use instead
`elixir_esp32boot.avm`, or the Elixir release flavor when using an image.
- ESP32: partitioning schema for Elixir flavor is different, so app offset has been changed for
Elixir images. Make sure to use `0x250000` as offset in your mix.exs or when performing manual
flashing.
- ESP32 a bug was discovered in `i2c:write_bytes/2` that has not been fixed yet. Writing bytes
sequentally using `i2c:write_byte/2` still works as a temporary workaround.
- STM32 devices with 512k of flash are not supported in this release, due to lack of
flash space. Support may return in a future release.

## v0.6.0-beta.1 -> v0.6.0-rc.0

- Drivers that send messages from Esp32 callbacks should use new functions
`port_send_message_from_task`, `globalcontext_send_message_from_task` or
`memory_destroy_heap_from_task` instead of `port_send_message`,
`globalcontext_send_message` and `memory_destroy_heap`.

## v0.6.0-alpha.2 -> v0.6.0-beta.0

- Registers are no longer preserved by GC by default when invoking nifs, as part of the fix
of interpretation of the emulator of the live parameter of many opcodes. NIFs may need
to call `memory_ensure_free_with_roots` and pass their arguments are roots, instead of
`memory_ensure_free` or `memory_ensure_free_opt`.
- Port call message tuple format has been changed, hence previous version of the standard library
  cannot be used. **Libraries (or boot .avm file) from latest version must be used**.

## v0.6.0-alpha.0 -> v0.6.0-alpha.1

- **Libraries (or boot .avm file) from latest version must be used**. Standard library from
`v0.6.0-alpha.0` cannot work on top of latest version.
- Address (offset) of programs for Pico was changed from 0x100A0000 to 0x10100000. UF2
binaries need to be rebuilt with the proper offset using `uf2tool`.
- On ESP32, SSID and PSK stored in NVS are no longer read by network module. Applications
must fetch the values and pass them to `network:start/1` or `network:start_link/1`.
- The `lib.avm` partition is no longer supported on ESP32.  If you have been using a
spacialized partitioning of your ESP32 flash (uncommon), AtomVM will no longer try to load
code off this partition name.
