AtomVM
===========

Brings [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and other functional
languages to really small systems.

AtomVM implements from scratch a minimal Erlang VM that supports a subset of ErlangVM features and that is able to run unmodified BEAM binaries on really small systems like MCUs.

Supported Platforms
===================

* Linux, macOS, FreeBSD ([generic unix](src/platforms/generic_unix))
* ESP32 SoC (with IDF/FreeRTOS, see [README.ESP32.Md](README.ESP32.Md))
* STM32 MCUs (with LibOpenCM3, see [README.STM32.Md](README.STM32.Md))

AtomVM aims to be easily portable to new platforms with a minimum effort, so additional platforms
might be supported in a near future.

Getting Started
===============

Dependencies
------------

Required for building:
* CMake ([CMake build system](https://cmake.org/))
* gperf ([GNU Perfect Hash Function Generator](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html))
* erlc ([erlang compiler](https://www.erlang.org/))

Optional:
* zlib ([zlib compression and decompression library](https://zlib.net/)) is optionally needed to run
  standard BEAM files (without uncompressed literals extension).

Documentation and Coverage:
* gcov and lcov are optionally required to generate coverage report (`make coverage`).
* doxygen is optionally required to generate documentation (`make doc`).

Step-by-Step Build Instructions (generic unix platform)
-------------------------------------------------------

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./src/AtomVM ./examples/erlang/hello_world.avm
```

See also [README.ESP32.Md](README.ESP32.Md) and [README.STM32.Md](README.STM32.Md) for platform
specific build instructions.

Project Status
==============

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml)

AtomVM is still in its early stages, but it can run simple applications similar to those available
in [examples](examples/) and [tests](tests/).

AtomVM might crash with a similar message:
```
Undecoded opcode: 15
Aborted (core dumped)
```
This basically means that an instruction has not been implemented yet, or that an outdated version has been used. Please, make sure to always run AtomVM using latest version.

**Right now only binaries compiled with OTP 20-23 are supported.**

Known Limitations
-----------------
This project is a work in progress, so there are several known limitations, that will prevent to run unmodified software, some of them are:
* There is a minimal standard library, so several standard functions are missing.
* Several instructions are not yet implemented.

All of these limitations are going to be fixed in a reasonable amount of time.
