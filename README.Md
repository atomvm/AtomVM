AtomVM
===========

Brings [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and other functional
languages to really small systems.

AtomVM implements from scratch a minimal Erlang VM that supports a subset of ErlangVM features and that is able to run unmodified BEAM binaries on really small systems like MCUs.

Supported Platforms
===================

* Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, DragonFly ([generic_unix](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-on-the-generic-unix-platform))
* ESP32 SoC (with IDF/FreeRTOS, see [esp32](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-on-the-esp32-platform))
* STM32 MCUs (with LibOpenCM3, see [stm32](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-on-the-stm32-platform))
* Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2 (see [rp2](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-on-the-raspberry-pi-pico-platform))
* Browsers and NodeJS with WebAssembly (see [emscripten](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-with-atomvm-webassembly))

AtomVM aims to be easily portable to new platforms with a minimum effort, so additional platforms
might be supported in a near future.

Getting Started
===============
There is much more information, including a more complete
["Getting Started Guide"](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/getting-started-guide.html),
[examples](https://atomvm.org/sample-code),
detailed [build instructions](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html),
and [contact information](https://atomvm.org/contact) available on the
[AtomVM](https://atomvm.org) project website.

>Don't forget to check out the [examples repository](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples) to
>help get you started on your next IoT project.

**Please, use [v0.6.x](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/tree/release-0.6) releases, main branch
is for development purposes and it might be unstable.**

Dependencies
------------

Required for building:
* CMake ([CMake build system](https://cmake.org/))
* gperf ([GNU Perfect Hash Function Generator](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html))
* erlc ([erlang compiler](https://www.erlang.org/))
* elixirc ([elixir compiler](https://elixir-lang.org))
* rebar3 ([rebar3 build tool](https://www.rebar3.org/))
* Mbed TLS ([portable TLS library, optionally required to support SSL](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/))
* zlib ([zlib compression and decompression library](https://zlib.net/))

Documentation and Coverage:
* gcov and lcov are optionally required to generate coverage report (`make coverage`).
* For documentation build requirements consult the [Documentation README](doc/README.md).

Step-by-Step Build Instructions (generic unix platform)
-------------------------------------------------------

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./src/AtomVM ./examples/erlang/hello_world.avm
```

Complete [Build Instructions](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html) are
available in the documentation for
[Generic UNIX](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html) (Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, DragonFly),
[ESP32](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html#building-for-esp32),
[STM32](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html#building-for-stm32),
[Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html#building-for-raspberry-pi-pico)
(rp2), and
[WASM](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/build-instructions.html#building-for-nodejs-web) (NodeJS/Web).

Project Status
==============

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml)

AtomVM is no longer just a prototype ‚Äî it has reached a solid level of compatibility with the BEAM
ecosystem. It can execute unmodified, compiled BEAM modules, and most
[core standard library functions](https://doc.atomvm.org/main/api-reference-documentation.html)
are already supported.

AtomVM is tested with code compiled with any version from OTP 21 to 27 (28 is supported only in `main` branch).

Crashes may still occur in edge cases, so we recommend using either the
[latest stable release](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases)
[(v0.6.x)](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/tree/release-0.6) or the
[main branch](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/tree/main) if you're experimenting with newer
features.
If you run into issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues/new/choose)
 ‚Äî we‚Äôd love your feedback.

For a detailed list of recent changes and new features, see the
[changelog](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

AtomVM is ready to power your next embedded or lightweight functional programming project.

Known Limitations
-----------------

Your existing project might not work out of the box due to a few current limitations:

- The standard library is minimal ‚Äî some functions and modules are not yet implemented.
- Features that depend on a full operating system (e.g. file I/O, OS processes) may be missing or
behave differently.
- Certain BEAM features like `on_load` functions and tracing are not yet supported.
- Some functionality may simply be missing ‚Äî if you find a gap, feel free to open an issue, and
we‚Äôll take a look.

When a feature is implemented, we aim to provide behavior that is consistent with the official
[BEAM documentation](https://www.erlang.org/docs) and
[Erlang/OTP runtime](https://github.com/erlang/otp).

Some of these limitations are on the roadmap, while others are deliberate design decisions to keep
AtomVM lightweight, portable, and suitable for embedded systems.
